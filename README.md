## Overview
This Python script utilizes various libraries for data analysis, manipulation, and forecasting of time series data. The script covers the following main aspects:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis
- Time series decomposition
- Forecasting using ARIMA model
- Visualizations for insights

## Libraries Used
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly
- Statsmodels

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Loading data from an Excel file into a Pandas DataFrame
- Checking for missing values and duplicates
- Data type conversions and column renaming for consistency
- Summary statistics and unique value counts in categorical columns

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Histograms and box plots for visualizing distributions by product category
- Seasonal decomposition for time series analysis
- Autocorrelation plots for assessing time series patterns

## Time Series Analysis and Forecasting
- Time series visualization over time
- Seasonal decomposition into trend, seasonality, and residuals
- Utilization of ARIMA model for time series forecasting
- Evaluation of the forecast using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
